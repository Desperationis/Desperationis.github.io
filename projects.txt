This game is a 2D multiplayer survival game focused on using natural resources to make technological advances to make survival easier, and is made by me and a friend known as Kirin. Various biomes exist, including forests, snowy mountains, deserts, and a magical forest, all with their unique set of creatures and armor.

Unfortunately, tools that documented RobotC functions into the RobotC function library simply do not exist. As such, this tool writes function documentation
directly into system files, and allows you to view their documentation as shown by the photo.

This library was made in RobotC, and includes multi-tasked functionalities such as PID Control, Slew Control, Gamer Control, and more. This library was tested
via <b>RobotCSimulator</b>, another one of my projects.

<b>Don't have a vex robot to program on?</b> Now you can use this simulator to simulate it!
This simulator, written in C++ and SFML was made for the purpose of testing my other VEX project, RobotCLibrary.

My first ever javascript project: An online calculator with formulas built into it. This was originally a tiny Code.hs sketch showing the power of Python's turtle module, but now it's available for the internet!

This is my implementation of Boids! This program was made to test my SFML Game Engine, which was abandoned after realizing how bad of an idea it was.

The first keychain I've made using Fusion 360. This perfect 2:1 gearbox can fit on your keys! Gears clip into place, and are separately printable. I was inspired by <a href ="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:525981">this</a> on thingiverse, and decided to learn how to make some myself.

My first program in SFML, written in C++. Basically, a controllable red square can cast rays of light, and shadows will appear in areas that don't
get that light.

A cellular automaton... sorta. Written in C++ and SDL, you can summon moving square blocks on the field for them to eat food, fight, inbreed, and die. 
As they summon with random speed and range, only some with a combination of the two will be able to take over the world. Adjusting these parameters are easy,
thanks to the <em>sexy</em>, handcrafted UI.
