## Hello!

Hello! I am a young self-taught programmer who has been programming for 4 years. ~~I made this website for the sole purpose of bragging rights.~~ I am still yet to learn more advanced topics in C++ and OpenGL, but I hope I can (eventually) learn them soon. Being a cringed 13 year old is tough, so my repositories and projects won't be seeing the light of day for long periods of time. Here a list of my projects and plans:

# Projects

- Snake
- Asteroids

# Plans

- Tweaking my SDL Library
- Learning SQL Databases and Servers
- Setting up a chat system
