                <em><h2>Welcome to my website!</em> (I guess.)</h2><br>
                <br>
                Hello! I am a young programmer who (you guessed it) programs in his free time. I made this website so I could start
                listing any projects I finish from here to the end of high school. I'm not sure who'll see this, but if you're a teacher,
                <em>do not ask me to fix anything other than a computer</em>. While I do enjoy fixing things, I have no experience fixing 
                microwaves, chairs, or failing marriages. Thank you.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                On the brighter side of things, I have created a list of things I want to accomplish before high school:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Make a chatroom. I want to do this so I can understand clients and servers.</li>
                <li>Compose a good chiptune song for a game.</li>
                <li>Fully understand the Entity Component System and make a platformer with it.</li>
                <li>Make a 3D shape in OpenGL and rotate it. I doubt I'll have enough brainpower to understand matrixes, or even artificial perspective, but I hope to do it soon. </li>
                <li>Finally, I want to learn OpenGL, XNA, or the .NET framework and enhance 2D visuals. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Pretty nerdy, right?</p>
