                            <p>All matches are going to be best out of 3. If you are not present when your match is up, then your opponent will be the default winner. If 
                                neither of you show up, then anyone facing the winner of that match will be declared the winner. This is also <b>not a exception for getting a refund. </b>
                                Game rules are as so:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Glitches are not allowed.</li> <br>
                                <li>No Pausing or Quitting during the match.</li> <br>
                                <li>If the game ends with a tie and leads to sudden death, then there will be a match reset with 1 stock. This is because range characters 
                                    would easily win sudden death. </li> <br>
